## Install & run

- You will need to run the API locally first, see the [API repository](https://github.com/Clonescody/crvusd-savor-api) for more informations.
- Once the API is setup, you need to add it's URL in the `.env.local` file (copy/rename the `.env.example` file and adapt it).

`Bun` is recommended to run the project as it is a banger dependency manager. You can still use `npm` or `yarn` if you wish.

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```
